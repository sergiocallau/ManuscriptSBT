'NonLinear_dependence.m':
Matlab script to visualize the non-linear dependence between the calibration parameters.

'Likelihood_scenario0X.mat':
Likelihoods of each scenario reached after the construction of the surrogate models.

'PD_Scenario_0x.mat'
Posterior distributions yielded in each scenario after the construction of the surrogate models.

'Prior_distribution_2x10^6.mat':
Matrix with 2*10e6 calibration parameters sets used to yield the posterior distributions.
Each column consists of sets of values for the three parameters identified to calibrate the models
(i.e., Background horizontal eddy viscosity and difussivity, and initial water temperature
profile)
