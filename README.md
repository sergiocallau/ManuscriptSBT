# Bayesian Active Learning with Gaussian Process Emulator Matlab Scripts

This repository contains the data for carrying out a Stochastic Calibration of a 3D Hydrodynamic Reservoir model with Delft3D-FLOW.

The repository contains two folders:
- `Model_Input`: files uploaded to the hydrodamic model.
- `Matlab_scripts`: scripts used to process the model outputs.

The `Matlab_Scripts` folder has two subfolders, notably, `BAL-GPE_Matlab_Toolbox` and `SBTSurrogateDomain`. The first subfolder contains all scripts to perform a stochastic calibration of the hydrodynamic model. The second subfolder contains scripts to assess calibration results in the reservoir domain. Furthermore,  the `MATLAB_Scripts` folder also provies the Matlab scripts `SurrogateDomainAnalysis_Manuscipt.m` and `Visualization_Manuscript.m`. Both scripts serve for producing figures shown in the manuscript that makes use of the here provided files (LINK TO BE SET AFTER PUBLICATION).
