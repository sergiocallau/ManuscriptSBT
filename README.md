# Bayesian Active Learning with Gaussian Process Emulator Matlab Scripts

This repository contains the data for carrying out a Stochastic Calibration of a 3D Hydrodynamic Reservoir model with Delft3D-FLOW.

The repository contains two folders:
- `Model_Input`: files uploaded to the hydrodamic model.
- `Matlab_scripts`: scripts used to process the model outputs.

The `Matlab_Scripts` folder has five subfolders, notably, `BAL_GPE`, `GPE_adjusted`, `ModelOutcomesVisualization`, `NonLinear_dependece` and `PosteriorDistributionsHistrograms`. The first subfolder contains all scripts to perform a stochastic calibration of the hydrodynamic model. The second, third, fourth and fifth subfolders contain scripts for production figures shown in the manuscript. Each of the above subfolders contains a file called `FilesDescription.txt` which presents a description of the here provided files (LINK TO BE SET AFTER PUBLICATION).
