# ManuscriptSBT
The current repository contains the data used to carried out a Stochastic Calibration of a 3D Hydrodynamic Reservoir model.
The repository contains two folders:
- Model_Input: files ploaded to the hydrodamic model.
- Matlab_Scripts: scripts used to process the model outputs.

The model Matlab_Scripts has two folders, BAL-GPE_Matlab_Toolbox and SBTSurrogateDomain. The first contains all the scripts applied to perform the stochastic calibration of the hydrodynamic model. The second folder has the scripts used to assess the calibration results in all the reservoir's domain. Furthermore, MATLAB_Scripts folder also presents the files "SurrogateDomainAnalysis_Manuscipt.m" and "Visualization_Manuscript.m", both scripts used to developed the manuscript figures.
